    "# Part 1: Questions to text and lectures.\n",
    "### A) Please answer my questions to the [Segal and Heer paper][1] we read during lecture 7 and 8. \n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: http://vis.stanford.edu/files/2010-Narrative-InfoVis.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What is the Oxford English Dictionary's defintion of a narrative? ######\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in the article, in **section 2.1 Narrative Structure** the Oxford English Dictionnary defines narrative as \n",
    ">“an account of a series of events, facts, etc., given in order and with the establishing of connections between them.”\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What is your favorite visualization among the examples in section 3? Explain why in a few words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our favourite visualization is the first one, **\"Steroids Or Not, the Pursuit is On.\"** posted in the  **New York Times**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we believe it is the most complete, easy-to-read and self-sufficient visualization. In fact, just by looking at it, one can easily understand the whole story behind what is represented and know through which order to navigate the information.This is done by a subtle but effective way, using visual highlighting and orchestrating graphical links between the three sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe Barry Bond's story showcases the best story-telling.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What's the point of Figure 7?\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 7 documents a list of 58 different visualizations. They are qualified following 3 criteria (which can each have sub-criterias): *Genre*, *Visual narrative* and *Narrative structure*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The point of this figure is to find patterns in the data used and show recurring element designs in order to identify trends in design choices and bring attention to similarities between same-type visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regions 1,2,3 and 4 are the trends that can be observed in this classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Use Figure 7 to find the most common design choice within each category for the Visual narrative and Narrative structure (the categories within visual narrative are 'visual structuring', 'highlighting', etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will present the most common design choice for each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Visual narrative**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Visual structuring*: \"**Consistent visual platform**\" followed by \"**Establishing shot/Splash screen**\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * *Highlighting*: \"**Feature Distinction**\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * *Transition guidance*: here there is no clear dominant choice, we can note that \"**Object continuity**\" and \"**Animated transitions**\" are used fairly often, and most of the times employed together. \"**Familiar objects**\" also appears almost as often. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Narrative structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Ordering*: \"**User directed paths**\". However, \"**Linear**\" also appears often.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Interactivity*: here we can see that the design choices of *Region 2* are most often present and used together. The ones that appear the most are \"**Filtering / Selection / Search**\", \"**Hover highlighting / Details**\", \"**Explicit instruction**\" and \"**Very limited interactivity**\". \"**Tacit tutorial**\" and \"**Stimulating default views**\" is clearly underused, this shows that interactivity is often very minor.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Messaging*: \"**Captions / Headlines**\" and \"**Annotations**\" are the two most used.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Check out Figure 8 and section 4.3. What is your favorite genre of narrative visualization? Why? What is your least favorite genre? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our favourite genre is the **Film / Video / Animation**. This type of narrative visualization can be used for complex data and stories aswell as for simpler ones. It can also work for most audiences, however, one downside is that it can only appear in a limited type of media. The **F / V / A** genre allows a high level of creativity and originality for the creator, and it can even contain other mentionned genres in it if wanted. On the other hand, a second downside could be the difficulty in incorporating interactivity in such a visualization. \n",
    "Despite that, we like the **F / V / A** because it is very complete, and easily understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our least favourite genre is the **Magazine style** for its lack of versatility. In fact, the amount of information it conveys is very limited and most of the time it requires a written support to be understood. It also can only be used in book/magazine-type media. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Also please answer the questions to my talk on [explanatory data visualization][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHKYMGwefso\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What are the three key elements to keep in mind when you design an explanatory visualization?\n",
    "1. **Start with a question**: before starting to design, you should know what you want to communicate to the audience. Look at the dataset, and decide what takeaways your visualization should have.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Allow exploration**: visualizations are more engaging if they allow the audience to create their own experience of how they discover it. A good visualization should be interactive and give freedom to the one who is consuming it.   In order to achieve that you can follow this 3-step principle: \"*Start by giving an overview*\", \"*Zoom and filter*\" and finally \"*Details on demand*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Know your readers**: it is very important to have in mind the target audience. You should be able to adapt your visualization depending on who you want to communicate to.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### In the video I talk about (1) overview first, (2) zoom and filter, (3) details on demand.\n",
    "* **Go online and find a visualization that follows these principles (don't use one from the video).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The [visualization we chose][3] is one that describes the shots taken by NBA players. We can see multiple statistics about their shots during one season. We can also select other players, and other seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3]: https://buckets.peterbeshai.com/app/#/playerView/201935_2015\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt](MainNBA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Explain how it does achieves (1)-(3). It might be useful to use screenshots to illustrate your explanation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Overview first**: when we select a player, on the middle of the page (next to the player face) there is a clear overview on the shots they took all over the court, and the colors+shapes give us general information on the frequency and the fg% of his shots.  \n",
    "    ![Alt](OverviewFirstNBA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Zoom and filter**: if we want we can filter the shots, and for example, show only the shot locations where the player took over 15 shots and he had over 50% fg%. \n",
    "    ![Alt](ZoomAndFilterNBA.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. **Details on demand**: finally it is possible to get further information about a certain shot location, by mooving the mouse over it. \n",
    "    ![Alt](DetailsOnDemandNBA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Explain in your own words: How is explanatory data analysis different from exploratory data analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that on one hand, **exploratory data** is used to **analyze data** and try to draw conclusions from the data behaviour we see. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **explanatory data** is used at a later stage, once the observations have been made and we want to **present our findings** to an audience. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are complementary, since explanatory data is based on exploratory, and exploratory data needs explanatory to be communicated.\n",
